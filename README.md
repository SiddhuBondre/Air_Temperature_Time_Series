# 🌡️ Air Temperature Time Series Dataset

# 📖 Overview

This dataset contains air temperature measurements over time, recorded at a specific location (or multiple stations). It is ideal for time series analysis, forecasting, climate trend studies, and anomaly detection.

The dataset captures temporal patterns, seasonality, and long-term trends, making it suitable for researchers, data scientists, and weather enthusiasts.

# 📊 Dataset Statistics

Total observations: X

Date range: YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD

Temperature range: Min X°C, Max Y°C

Average temperature: Z°C

Missing values: X%

# Preprocessing

Handle missing values (interpolation, forward-fill).

Resampling (e.g., daily → monthly average).

Feature engineering:

Lag features (yesterday’s temperature, last week’s avg, etc.)

Rolling averages

Time features (month, season, weekday, holiday)

# Modeling Approaches

📊 Traditional Time Series Models

ARIMA / SARIMA → captures trend + seasonality

Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)

🤖 Machine Learning Models

Random Forest, XGBoost (with lag/rolling features)

🧠 Deep Learning Models

LSTM / GRU (works well for long-term dependencies)

1D CNN + LSTM hybrid for feature extraction

# 🎯 Applications

Forecasting: Predict future temperatures using time series analysis.

Seasonal Analysis: Detect seasonal patterns such as summer/winter trends.

Climate Trends: Study long-term warming or cooling trends.

Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual temperature spikes or drops.

Visualization Projects: Create heatmaps, trend lines, or seasonal decomposition plots.

# ⚠️ Notes

Missing values are represented as NaN and should be handled appropriately.

Data may need resampling if observations are unevenly spaced.

Extreme temperature values may require validation.

Seasonal decomposition is recommended to understand trends and cyclic behavior.
